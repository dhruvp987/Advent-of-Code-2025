# My Advent of Code 2025 Solutions
This is the first Advent of Code I have ever done. To spice up the challenge, I've decided to complete it in Zig, which I have never used before but always wanted to try.

There will be lots of challenging fun and learning opportunities, so I will be sharing what I've learned for each day. You can read the learnings for each day under
their respective day folder.

Stay warm!
